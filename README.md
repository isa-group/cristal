=======

CRISTAL (Collection of Resource-centrIc Supporting Tools And Languages) is a set of tools aimed at providing advanced support for resource management in business processes. Most of its functionalities are based on RAL (Resource Assignment Language), a language to select human resources from an organizational model.
